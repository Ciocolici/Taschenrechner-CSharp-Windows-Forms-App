# Taschenrechner

A C# (CSharp) Windows Forms App project. Just a really basic calculator, able to do basic equations. My first project in Windows Forms, so please don't hate the horrible design and lack of features all calculators have.

Open "Taschenrechner V2.sln" to see the code. To run the Windows Forms App program directly, launch "Taschenrechner V2.exe" located in "bin/Release/net6.0-windows".
